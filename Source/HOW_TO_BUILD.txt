This project makes use of KSPBuildTools.
KSPBT is meant to make building KSP Plugins simpler.
To do so KSPBT needs a reference to your KSP install, KSPBT will look in default locations for steam installations on all operating systems.
But if your copy of KSP is not in any of these locations you will need to tell KSPBT where it is.
You can do this either by setting an enviroment variable named KSP_ROOT in your operating system that points to the ksp folder.
Or more likely by creating a (insert SolutionName here).props.user file in the same directory as the solution. that contains the following:

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<Project ToolsVersion="Current" xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/developer/msbuild/2003">
  <PropertyGroup>
    <KSPRoot>(PATH TO YOUR KSP FOLDER)</KSPRoot>
  </PropertyGroup>
</Project>


This file is not git tracked meaning any contributor will need to create this file manually if their install is not in a default location.
